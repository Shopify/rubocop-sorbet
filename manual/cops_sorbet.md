## Sorbet/AllowIncompatibleOverride

Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | VersionAdded | VersionChanged
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Enabled | Yes | No | 0.2.0 | -

Disallows using `.override(allow_incompatible: true)`.
Using `allow_incompatible` suggests a violation of the Liskov
Substitution Principle, meaning that a subclass is not a valid
subtype of its superclass. This Cop prevents these design smells
from occurring.

### Examples

```ruby
# bad
sig.override(allow_incompatible: true)

# good
sig.override
```

## Sorbet/BindingConstantWithoutTypeAlias

Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | VersionAdded | VersionChanged
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Enabled | Yes | Yes  | 0.2.0 | -

Disallows binding the return value of `T.any`, `T.all`, `T.enum`
to a constant directly. To bind the value, one must use `T.type_alias`.

### Examples

```ruby
# bad
FooOrBar = T.any(Foo, Bar)

# good
FooOrBar = T.type_alias { T.any(Foo, Bar) }
```

## Sorbet/BuggyObsoleteStrictMemoization

Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | VersionAdded | VersionChanged
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Enabled | Yes | Yes (Unsafe) | 0.7.3 | -

Checks for the a mistaken variant of the "obsolete memoization pattern" that used to be required
for older Sorbet versions in `#typed: strict` files. The mistaken variant would overwrite the ivar with `nil`
on every call, causing the memoized value to be discarded and recomputed on every call.

This cop will correct it to read from the ivar instead of `nil`, which will memoize it correctly.

The result of this correction will be the "obsolete memoization pattern", which can further be corrected by
the `Sorbet/ObsoleteStrictMemoization` cop.

See `Sorbet/ObsoleteStrictMemoization` for more details.

### Examples

```ruby
# bad
sig { returns(Foo) }
def foo
  # This `nil` is likely a mistake, causing the memoized value to be discarded and recomputed on every call.
  @foo = T.let(nil, T.nilable(Foo))
  @foo ||= some_computation
end

# good
sig { returns(Foo) }
def foo
  # This will now memoize the value as was likely intended, so `some_computation` is only ever called once.
  # ⚠️If `some_computation` has side effects, this might be a breaking change!
  @foo = T.let(@foo, T.nilable(Foo))
  @foo ||= some_computation
end
```

## Sorbet/CallbackConditionalsBinding

Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | VersionAdded | VersionChanged
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Disabled | No | Yes  | 0.7.0 | -

Ensures that callback conditionals are bound to the right type
so that they are type checked properly.

Auto-correction is unsafe because other libraries define similar style callbacks as Rails, but don't always need
binding to the attached class. Auto-correcting those usages can lead to false positives and auto-correction
introduces new typing errors.

### Examples

```ruby
# bad
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  before_create :do_it, if: -> { should_do_it? }

  def should_do_it?
    true
  end
end

# good
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  before_create :do_it, if: -> {
    T.bind(self, Post)
    should_do_it?
  }

  def should_do_it?
    true
  end
end
```

## Sorbet/CheckedTrueInSignature

Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | VersionAdded | VersionChanged
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Enabled | Yes | No | 0.2.0 | -

Disallows the usage of `checked(true)`. This usage could cause
confusion; it could lead some people to believe that a method would be checked
even if runtime checks have not been enabled on the class or globally.
Additionally, in the event where checks are enabled, `checked(true)` would
be redundant; only `checked(false)` or `soft` would change the behaviour.

### Examples

```ruby
# bad
sig { void.checked(true) }

# good
sig { void }
```

## Sorbet/ConstantsFromStrings

Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | VersionAdded | VersionChanged
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Enabled | Yes | No | 0.2.0 | -

Disallows the calls that are used to get constants fom Strings
such as +constantize+, +const_get+, and +constants+.

The goal of this cop is to make the code easier to statically analyze,
more IDE-friendly, and more predictable. It leads to code that clearly
expresses which values the constant can have.

### Examples

```ruby
# bad
class_name.constantize

# bad
constants.detect { |c| c.name == "User" }

# bad
const_get(class_name)

# good
case class_name
when "User"
  User
else
  raise ArgumentError
end

# good
{ "User" => User }.fetch(class_name)
```

## Sorbet/EmptyLineAfterSig

Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | VersionAdded | VersionChanged
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Enabled | Yes | Yes  | 0.7.0 | -

Checks for blank lines after signatures.

### Examples

```ruby
# bad
sig { void }

def foo; end

# good
sig { void }
def foo; end
```

## Sorbet/EnforceSigilOrder

Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | VersionAdded | VersionChanged
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Enabled | Yes | Yes  | 0.3.4 | -

Checks that the Sorbet sigil comes as the first magic comment in the file, after the encoding comment if any.

The expected order for magic comments is: (en)?coding, typed, warn_indent then frozen_string_literal.

The ordering is for consistency only, except for the encoding comment which must be first, if present.

For example, the following bad ordering:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true
# typed: true
class Foo; end
```

Will be corrected as:

```ruby
# typed: true
# frozen_string_literal: true
class Foo; end
```

Only `(en)?coding`, `typed`, `warn_indent` and `frozen_string_literal` magic comments are considered,
other comments or magic comments are left in the same place.

## Sorbet/EnforceSignatures

Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | VersionAdded | VersionChanged
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Disabled | Yes | Yes  | 0.3.4 | -

Checks that every method definition and attribute accessor has a Sorbet signature.

It also suggest an autocorrect with placeholders so the following code:

```
def foo(a, b, c); end
```

Will be corrected as:

```
sig { params(a: T.untyped, b: T.untyped, c: T.untyped).returns(T.untyped)
def foo(a, b, c); end
```

You can configure the placeholders used by changing the following options:

* `ParameterTypePlaceholder`: placeholders used for parameter types (default: 'T.untyped')
* `ReturnTypePlaceholder`: placeholders used for return types (default: 'T.untyped')

## Sorbet/EnforceSingleSigil

Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | VersionAdded | VersionChanged
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Enabled | Yes | Yes  | 0.7.0 | -

Checks that there is only one Sorbet sigil in a given file

For example, the following class with two sigils

```ruby
# typed: true
# typed: true
# frozen_string_literal: true
class Foo; end
```

Will be corrected as:

```ruby
# typed: true
# frozen_string_literal: true
class Foo; end
```

Other comments or magic comments are left in place.

## Sorbet/FalseSigil

Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | VersionAdded | VersionChanged
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Enabled | Yes | Yes  | 0.3.3 | -

Makes the Sorbet `false` sigil mandatory in all files.

  include Comparable

  enums do
    High = new(3)
    Medium = new(2)
    Low = new(1)
  end

  def <=>(other)
    serialize <=> other.serialize
  end
end
```

## Sorbet/ForbidExtendTSigHelpersInShims

Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | VersionAdded | VersionChanged
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Enabled | Yes | Yes  | 0.6.0 | -

Ensures RBI shims do not include a call to extend T::Sig
or to extend T::Helpers

### Examples

```ruby
# bad
module SomeModule
  extend T::Sig
  extend T::Helpers

  sig { returns(String) }
  def foo; end
end

# good

## Sorbet/HasSigil

Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | VersionAdded | VersionChanged
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Disabled | Yes | Yes  | 0.3.3 | -

Makes the Sorbet typed sigil mandatory in all files.

Options:

* `SuggestedStrictness`: Sorbet strictness level suggested in offense messages (default: 'false')

Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | VersionAdded | VersionChanged
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Enabled | Yes | No | 0.2.0 | -

Checks for the ordering of keyword arguments required by
sorbet-runtime. The ordering requires that all keyword arguments
are at the end of the parameters list, and all keyword arguments
with a default value must be after those without default values.

### Examples

```ruby
# bad
sig { params(a: Integer, b: String).void }
def foo(a: 1, b:); end

# good

## Sorbet/ObsoleteStrictMemoization

Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | VersionAdded | VersionChanged
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Enabled | Yes | Yes  | 0.7.1 | -

Checks for the obsolete pattern for initializing instance variables that was required for older Sorbet
versions in `#typed: strict` files.

It's no longer required, as of Sorbet 0.5.10210
See https://sorbet.org/docs/type-assertions#put-type-assertions-behind-memoization

### Examples

```ruby
# bad
sig { returns(Foo) }
def foo
  @foo = T.let(@foo, T.nilable(Foo))
  @foo ||= Foo.new
end

# bad
sig { returns(Foo) }
def foo
  # This would have been a mistake, causing the memoized value to be discarded and recomputed on every call.
  @foo = T.let(nil, T.nilable(Foo))
  @foo ||= Foo.new
end

# good
sig { returns(Foo) }
def foo
  @foo ||= T.let(Foo.new, T.nilable(Foo))
end
```

## Sorbet/RedundantExtendTSig

Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | VersionAdded | VersionChanged
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Disabled | No | Yes  | 0.7.0 | -

Forbids the use of redundant `extend T::Sig`. Only for use in
applications that monkey patch `Module.include(T::Sig)` globally,
which would make it redundant.

### Examples

```ruby
# bad
class Example
  extend T::Sig
  sig { void }
  def no_op; end
end

# good
class Example
  sig { void }
  def no_op; end
end
```

Options:

* `Order`: The order in which to enforce the builder methods are called.

### Examples

```ruby
# bad
sig { void.abstract }

# good
sig { abstract.void }

# bad
sig { returns(Integer).params(x: Integer) }

# good
sig { params(x: Integer).returns(Integer) }
```

## Sorbet/ValidSigil

Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | VersionAdded | VersionChanged
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Enabled | Yes | Yes  | 0.3.3 | -

Checks that every Ruby file contains a valid Sorbet sigil.
Adapted from: https://gist.github.com/clarkdave/85aca4e16f33fd52aceb6a0a29936e52

Options:

* `RequireSigilOnAllFiles`: make offense if the Sorbet typed is not found in the file (default: false)
* `SuggestedStrictness`: Sorbet strictness level suggested in offense messages (default: 'false')
* `MinimumStrictness`: If set, make offense if the strictness level in the file is below this one
* `ExactStrictness`: If set, make offense if the strictness level in the file is different than this one

If an `ExactStrictness` level is specified, it will be used in offense messages and autocorrect.
Otherwise, if a `MinimumStrictness` level is specified, it will be used in offense messages and autocorrect.

## Sorbet/VoidCheckedTests

Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | VersionAdded | VersionChanged
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Enabled | Yes | Yes  | 0.7.7 | -

Disallows the usage of `.void.checked(:tests)`.

Using `.void` changes the value returned from the method, but only if
runtime type checking is enabled for the method. Methods marked `.void`
will return different values in tests compared with non-test
environments. This is particularly troublesome if branching on the
result of a `.void` method, because the returned value in test code
will be the truthy `VOID` value, while the non-test return value may be
falsy depending on the method's implementation.

- Use `.returns(T.anything).checked(:tests)` to keep the runtime type
  checking for the rest of the parameters.
- Use `.void.checked(:never)` if you are on an older version of Sorbet
  which does not have `T.anything` (meaning versions 0.5.10781 or
  earlier. Versions released after 2023-04-14 include `T.anything`.)

### Examples

```ruby
# bad
sig { void.checked(:tests) }

# good
sig { void }
sig { returns(T.anything).checked(:tests) }
sig { void.checked(:never) }
```
